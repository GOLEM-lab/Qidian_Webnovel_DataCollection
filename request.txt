Solutions:

1) LightNovel crawler (https://github.com/dipu-bd/lightnovel-crawler) gets the books from webnovel.com. The disadvantage is you need to give the book url. It is a command-line tool.
2) Think of using selenium wire to collect all the network traffic (https://github.com/wkeeling/selenium-wire)
